## Challenge I have when creating the Portfolio
1. "About Portfolio Contact" was stack on top of each other, I fixed it by adding 
   ```HTML
   <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg">
    ```
2. "About Portfoli Conact" were not moving to the right side, I add the following codes fixed them:
   ```HTML

   ```HTML
   <div class="card-img-overlay">
    ```
